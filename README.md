# Elm Blog

Simple blog web application written in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org).

This project will use the API written in my other repo [Levyks/spring_blog](https://github.com/Levyks/spring_blog).

This is a (probably long) work in progress, as I have never worked with Elm before.

<b>Elm</b> is a functional programming language for building front-end web applications that compiles to JavaScript.

"A delightful language with friendly error messages, great performance, small assets, and no runtime exceptions"

It promises to make refactoring of big applications easy and hassle-free. Since there are no side effects to worry about (as a functional language), and its strongly typed system.
